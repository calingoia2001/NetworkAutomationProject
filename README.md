This project aims to implement a graphical user interface in Python that allows the user, who may be a network administrator, to automatically configure and manage a network topology. In the case of this project the network topology has been emulated using GNS3 and contains several routers and switches running on the GNS3 virtual machine. The network devices in this topology are accessed via the SSH protocol by several scripts made in Python using the Nornir library. These scripts are called by the user through the graphical user interface made with the Tkinter library. The scripts and GUI run from an Ubuntu Docker container that is also in the network topology.
